Hi 👋 , I am Miryam (she/her), a Computational Linguistics researcher. I am currently funded by an international postdoc grant from the [Swedish Research Council](http://vr.se), for which I am affiliated with the [Computational Linguistics group](http://cl.lingfil.uu.se/people) at [Uppsala University](http://uu.se) in Sweden 🇸🇪 , the [Language Intelligence & Information Retrieval Lab (LIIR)](https://liir.cs.kuleuven.be/) at [KU Leuven](http://kuleuven.be) in Belgium 🇧🇪, the [CopeNLU](http://www.copenlu.com/) and the [CoAStAL](http://coastalcph.github.io/) groups at the [University of Copenhagen](https://www.ku.dk/) in Denmark 🇩🇰. My project is about typologically informed dependency parsing. 
<br>

I obtained a PhD in Computational Linguistics at Uppsala University and before that, I got an MSc degree in Artificial Intelligence at [the University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/) in Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
and a BA and MA in languages and literatures at [UCLouvain](https://uclouvain.be/) in Belgium.

My research interests are centered around three main themes in the domain of AI and language: **syntactic parsing**, **typology** and **interpretability**. I find syntactic parsing an exciting area because it allows exploring interesting linguistic phenomena while working on a system that is central to NLP and useful to many applications. I find it important to develop models that work for typologically diverse languages and I find it interesting to study the interaction between language technology and typology. I finally find it important to go beyond building models that function as a black box and reason about what they are learning and why. I have combined all of these interests in my PhD  where I investigated linguistically informed models of syntactic parsing for typologically diverse languages. My PhD thesis is available [here](http://cl.lingfil.uu.se/~miryam/papers/thesis.pdf).

When I'm not busy with work things, I enjoy watching and playing football, trying new beers or hiking in the nature, preferably in the mountains.
